# Learning OpenCV 5 Computer Vision with Python 3 - Fourth Edition 

This is the code repository for our upcoming book *Learning OpenCV 5 Computer Vision with Python 3 - Fourth Edition*, which will be published by Packt after the release of OpenCV 5.

You may find this repository interesting as a preview of things to come in the next (Fourth) edition of our classic guide to OpenCV and Python. Alternatively, to find the stable code for the book's current (Third) edition, targeting OpenCV 4, please go to https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learning-OpenCV-4-Computer-Vision-with-Python-Third-Edition.

Thank you for your continued interest in the bright future of computer vision!

Best wishes,

Joseph Howse and Joe Minichino
